    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Autoclave App</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information. The app is designed to connect and control an autoclave controller, facilitating communication and adjustments via an MQTT server.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID:</strong> When you install the app, you are required to enter the Device ID provided by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Wi-Fi Network Details:</strong> From the app settings, you can view and modify the name and password of the Wi-Fi network to which the controller connects.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Data:</strong> The app periodically queries the autoclave controller for data, such as current temperature, time remaining, and status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate communication between the app and the autoclave controller via the MQTT server.</li>
        <li>To allow users to adjust autoclaving parameters such as temperature and time.</li>
        <li>To display real-time operational data from the controller within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. However, the following exceptions may apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data exchanged between the app and the autoclave controller via the MQTT server.</li>
        <li>Legal requirements: If required by law, we may disclose information to authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard measures to protect your information. Data exchanged via the MQTT server is handled through the HiveMQ MQTT broker, which is reliable and ensures encrypted communication for secure data transfer.</p>

    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete the data you have entered into the app. For assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:vt@tonkov.eu">vt@tonkov.eu</a>.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
